<!-- 
    This file exists because of a complex hosting situation.
    This website was originally deployed with GitHub Pages to 
    https://www.austincoleman.dev/rep-recorder/ 
    I have a different Github repo deployed with GitHub Pages 
    currently linked to https://www.austincoleman.dev/ 
    But then I got the domain https://www.reprecorder.dev/ and 
    changed to deploying with Vercel.
    I previously sent out resumes linking to 
    https://www.austincoleman.dev/rep-recorder/ so I didn't want
    those links to break. So the only way to ensure it redirected
    was to add this 404.html, .nojekyll, and deploy with github pages 
    and vercel.
    Eventually I plan to remove this.
