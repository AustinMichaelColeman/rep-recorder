# rep-recorder

A workout tracking website. The data will be local to the browser, perhaps with the ability to back up and restore the data to the user's Google Drive.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploying

First you can see what a deploy would look like locally like this:

```bash
npm run predeploy
npm run preview
```

The .github/deploy.yml should automatically deploy when you commit to main.
